# RNA-seq identifies markers of high altitude exercise adaptation 

This repository describes the analysis of whole blood RNA-seq of elite skaters before and after intense exercise, with high altitude adaptation.

Seven elite female speed skaters spent 18 days in live-high, train-high (LHTH) setting. After 18 days, whole blood samples were collected before and after an intense bout of exercise. Samples were globin-depleted and sequenced using poly-A selected, strand-specific RNA-seq.

## Data

Expression tables generated by STAR + rsem [pipeline](https://github.com/apredeus/rnaquant), as well as some annotation files necessary to reproduce the analysis. Place all the files into your working directory and unpack them. Raw RNA-seq reads were deposited in GEO database as [GSE164890](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE164890).

## Analysis

  * `functions.R` contain all necessary R functions that need to be sourced before performing other analysis. 
  * `differential_expression.R` shows full exploration and differential expression analysis of the dataset, as well as functional pathway enrichments and comparison to published microarray data. 
  * `single_cell.R` shows quick analysis of two single cell RNA-seq datasets ([GSE149938](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149938) and [10x Genomics PBMC 10k](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/4.0.0/SC3_v3_NextGem_DI_PBMC_10K)) used to put our results in the context of blood cell types. 
  * `metabolic_network.R` describes the construction of most-perturbed subnetwork of metabolic reactions from RNA-seq data using GATOM.  

## Figures

All manuscipt figures (aside from the heatmaps generated in [Phantasus](http://genome.ifmo.ru/phantasus-dev/)) can be reproduced using the R scripts in this repository.
