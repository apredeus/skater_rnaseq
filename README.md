# RNA-seq identifies markers of high altitude exercise adaptation 

This repository describes the analysis of whole blood RNA-seq of elite skaters before and after intense exercise, with high altitude adaptation.

Seven elite female speed skaters spent 18 days in live-high, train-high (LHTH) setting. After 18 days, whole blood samples were collected before and after an intense bout of exercise. Samples were globin-depleted and sequenced using poly-A selected, strand-specific RNA-seq.

## Data

Expression tables generated by STAR + rsem [pipeline](https://github.com/apredeus/rnaquant), as well as some annotation files necessary to reproduce the analysis. Place all the files into your working directory and unpack them. Raw RNA-seq reads were deposited in GEO database as [GSE164890](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE164890).

## Analysis

  * `functions.R` contain all necessary R functions that need to be sourced before performing other analysis; 
  * `all_analysis_and_figures.R` contains all the analysis and data visualization code:
    * differential expression, batch correction, and PCA analysis of the bulk RNA-seq data; 
    * pathway enrichment with `fGSEA` and `clusterProfiler`; 
    * putting our dataset in context of previously published microarray datasets (8 experiments); 
    * generating exclusive markers for all major cell types present in whole blood; 
    * identification of cell type populations from the bulk RNA-seq; 
    * annotation and plotting of key genes up- and down-regulated after exercise at high elevation; 
    * correlation plot for peer review. 

Single cell RNA-seq datasets that were used to generate the cell type signatures for most cell types present in whole blood are [GSE149938](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149938) and [10x Genomics PBMC 10k](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/4.0.0/SC3_v3_NextGem_DI_PBMC_10K).
